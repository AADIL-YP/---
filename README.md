CALCULATOR 
It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic
mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and
JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to
perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction,
division, and multiplication. It will need a
display screen to
display the userâ€™s input and give the results. The grid system
in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator.
The additional tools you need to build a fully functional
calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements,
operators, loops, and so on.
